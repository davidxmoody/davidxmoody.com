        <p>I have recently written about the <a href="/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/">growth mindset</a>.
          When you have a growth mindset, you believe that your basic abilities
          can be improved with hard work and practice. </p>
        <p>There are plenty things in my life I want to improve. However, I&#39;m going
          to start with exercise. I&#39;ve previously tried and failed to form exercise
          habits. None of my attempts have made any lasting improvements. This time
          I want it to be different. This time I&#39;m going to make it <strong>so easy I can&#39;t fail</strong>.</p>
        <!--more-->

        <h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>
        <p>There are lots of exercise plans out there. Far too many in fact. I once
          tried the <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/">one hundred push ups training program</a>          but never stuck to it. I could write a whole article about why new habits
          fail. I&#39;ll save that for later. Right now, I want to form the habit
          of doing push ups. I want it to be <em>simple</em>, <em>easy</em> and
          <em>repeatable daily</em>. </p>
        <p>My plan is to do <em>exactly two push ups</em> every single morning this
          week. Next week, I will do <em>exactly four push ups</em> every single
          morning. The week after, <em>exactly six push ups</em> every single morning.
          </p>
        <p>And so on. In just under a year, I will be doing 100 push ups a day (hence
          the title). </p>
        <h2 id="so-easy-i-can-t-fail">So easy I can&#39;t fail</h2>
        <p>I can currently do <em>seven</em> good-form push ups. In some ways, doing
          just two per day in the first week feels <em>too easy</em>. I already
          know that it&#39;s not going to be challenging. However, that&#39;s the
          point. <em>It&#39;s supposed to be easy</em>. </p>
        <p>I don&#39;t know if my plan will eventually become too hard. I might have
          to add rest days or short rests between sets of push ups. I&#39;ll just
          have to see how it goes. </p>
        <p><a href="http://jamesclear.com/">James Clear</a> has written a lot about
          <a href="http://jamesclear.com/slow-gains">how slow gains add up quickly</a>.
          I want this new habit to stick. I trying to do that by keeping it easy
          and simple and doing it every single day. </p>
        <h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>
        <p>I&#39;m also writing about it on this blog for public accountability. In
          fact, rather than just writing this post and forgetting about it, I&#39;m
          going to go one step further. I&#39;m going to keep a log of the exact
          number of push ups I do every day and place it right here. </p>
        <p><em>[Note that I might not get around to pushing updates every single day so expect this graph to lag behind a little bit. Dashes represent no record and zeros represent no push ups that day.]</em>
