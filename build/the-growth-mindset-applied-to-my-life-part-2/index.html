        <p>Continued from <a href="/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/">part 1</a>.
          This part will discuss how the different mindsets affected me after I
          left university.</p>
        <h2 id="post-cambridge">Post Cambridge</h2>
        <p>I was absolutely gutted when I didn&#39;t get a first class honours in my
          final exams. My <em>only</em> plan had been to stay for a fourth year
          at Cambridge. When that was no longer possible, I was stuck. I labelled
          myself as a &quot;failure&quot;. It took me a long time to get over it.
          </p>
        <p><em>[I left Cambridge just over three years ago. I&#39;m going to be skipping over a lot and focusing on the things important to this story.]</em>
        </p>
        <p>I stayed with my parents and spent a long time drifting with no clear purpose.
          I started to focus on non-career goals. I successfully lost a lot of weight
          (from 220lbs to 150lbs). I also learned to cook and passed my driving
          test. </p>
        <p>In some areas of my life, I had an <em>unconscious</em> growth mindset.
          For example, with losing weight, I found it incredibly easy once I started.
          I never doubted that I would reach my final goal. I still had an incredibly
          fixed mindset in many other areas of my life. Most notably, my career
          and social skills. </p>
        <h2 id="fun-with-linux">Fun with Linux</h2>
        <p>For reasons that I can&#39;t remember, I started to develop an interest
          in Linux. I had a small netbook with Ubuntu and I set up my desktop to
          dual-boot. </p>
        <p>One night when I couldn&#39;t sleep, I started reading a tutorial on Bash
          scripting. I was inexperienced with the Linux command line and I was very
          <em>curious</em> about how to use it properly. That curiosity drove me
          to learn everything I could about Bash. I started playing around. I created
          scripts for doing all kinds of things. It was a lot of fun. I also started
          using Vim as my text editor. It was hard to learn but I knew it would
          be worth it. </p>
        <p>At some point, I realised that Bash wasn&#39;t suitable for everything.
          I switched my attention to Python. I practised on <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>          problems. I also started work on a command line program for organising
          my personal diary. I plan to write a full post about my diary project
          later. For now, I&#39;ll just say that it was a pretty significant project
          for me. It has over 300 commits and has taken me many hundreds of hours.
          I have re-written it several times over. I feel I learned more about software
          development from that project than anything else before it. </p>
        <p>All of the above are what I like to think of as <strong>natural growth</strong>.
          I was very <em>curious</em> about these things and that caused me to explore
          and learn on my own. I feel it also led me to develop a sort of <em>unconscious growth mindset</em>.
          I became very familiar with learning about new technologies. I accepted
          that I could probably learn anything with enough time and effort. However,
          I most definitely still had a fixed mindset in many areas.</p>
        <h2 id="the-professor-p-website">The Professor P website</h2>
        <p>My father is the author of the <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/books/">Professor P series of children&#39;s books</a>.
          A while ago, he made a website for the series which included several JavaScript
          games. It wasn&#39;t bad but it did look a bit dated. Also, many of the
          games did not work on modern browsers. We decided I should re-make the
          games. </p>
        <p>At the time, the only way I knew how to do this was to use Java applets.
          I remember sitting down with my Dad to have a look at some existing Java
          games. We were blown away by how absolutely terrible the Java installation
          process was. It took about two minutes and 15 clicks to get Java running
          in the browser. Pretty bad when compared to the JavaScript games, which
          worked instantly.</p>
        <p>I then set out on an ambitious adventure to learn everything I could about
          HTML and JavaScript. I created <em>many</em> iterations of my first game,
          a tile sliding puzzle. I spent a long time on it and learned a lot in
          the process. I refactored it many times. I eventually added an intelligent
          AI opponent to race against the player (it uses a variation on the
          <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search algorithm</a>). You can play the game <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/games/shuffle/">right now on the Professor P website</a>.
            </p>
        <p>I added <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/games/">four other games</a>, including
          a <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/games/sharkattack/">shark attack game</a>,
          a <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/games/memory/">memory card game</a>,
          a <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/games/quiz/">quiz game</a> and a
          <a
          href="http://professorp.co.uk/games/wordsearch/">wordsearch game</a> (which I&#39;ve <a href="/wordsearch-game/">already written about</a>).
            Each was challenging in its own way and I learned a lot from all of
            them. I also spent a long time making <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">the rest of the website</a>            with a static site generator (<a href="http://docpad.org/">DocPad</a>).
            </p>
        <p>The whole thing took me about a year, although I did have a very slow start.
          I went through intense periods of passion-fuelled work followed by periods
          of boredom-filled procrastination. <a href="/the-pomodoro-technique-what-i-wish-id-known/">I&#39;ve written about this before</a>          but it slowly got better. I&#39;m very proud of the Professor P website.
          If I could start again, there are many things I would do differently.
          However, I feel it represents a lot of growth in my ability. </p>
        <h2 id="this-blog">This blog</h2>
        <p>That brings me to my most recent project, <em>this blog</em>. I had wanted
          to start one for ages but had always put it off. Mostly out of a fear
          of not being good enough but also out of laziness. I knew it was going
          to be <em>challenging</em> but I stuck with it. I <em>wanted to grow</em>          as a software developer and as a person. </p>
        <p>I have written 14 posts so far (which has taken approximately 50 hours).
          I set myself a schedule and have stuck to it without fail. It&#39;s been
          hard work. It&#39;s difficult to quantify but I <em>feel</em> like I&#39;ve
          already got a lot better at the process of writing. </p>
        <p>One specific decision I&#39;m pleased I made was to only publish my &quot;best&quot;
          content. I have been writing a personal diary for nearly four years. I
          just throw any old words into that with minimal editing. I could have
          done that for this blog but I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t. Editing my own
          words is one of the hardest parts of writing. I could have <em>easily</em>          written ten times as much if I hadn&#39;t bothered with editing or planning.
          </p>
        <h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>
        <p>Despite my success with blogging so far, it is too much of a &quot;meta&quot;
          activity. That is, I have to write <em>about</em> something else. Out
          of the 14 posts I&#39;ve written so far, 5 have been about blogging or
          setting up this blog, 7 have been about things I had already done and
          2 have been about <em>new</em> things (which I had no experience with
          before writing the post). The problem is, I don&#39;t want to write about
          blogging too much and I will eventually run out of things which I have
          already done. I need some new projects to work on. </p>
        <p>My blog is the perfect way to challenge myself in other areas. Public commitment
          is very powerful. It&#39;s been the main reason I have been able to stick
          to my blogging schedule so far. </p>
        <p>In the future, I plan to set myself <em>specific challenges</em> and then
          write about them. There are many areas in which I want to grow and I have
          lots of ideas for challenges. </p>
