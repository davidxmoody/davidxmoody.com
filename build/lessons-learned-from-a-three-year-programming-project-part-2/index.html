        <h2 id="abstraction-and-small-methods">Abstraction and small methods</h2>
        <p>This lesson was something I learned slowly over the course of the project.
          I always &quot;knew&quot; the advantages of hiding implementation details
          in small methods. I had been taught it in university after all. </p>
        <p>However, when it came to actually writing code, I consistently ended up
          with massive unreadable functions. In my early Bash scripts for example,
          I had copy-pasted the code for iterating over all entries about <em>five different times</em>.</p>
        <p>It took a while for me to <em>intuitively understand</em> the concepts but
          I slowly got better. In my early versions, every single script depended
          on the exact same filesystem layout. In my current version, every single
          file depends on one <code>Entry</code> class which has many smaller methods.
          That class could change the filesystem layout any time it wants and it
          wouldn&#39;t affect anything else. It could switch to a database or a
          remote filesystem and none of the other modules would notice.</p>
        <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&#39;t_repeat_yourself">don&#39;t repeat yourself</a>          principle (and its various corollaries) feels so <em>obvious</em> now.
          However, in practice, it still took me a long time to actually get to
          grips with what it really meant.</p>
        <p><strong>Lesson 4:</strong> Don&#39;t repeat yourself. </p>
        <h2 id="cli-and-polish">CLI and polish</h2>
        <p>Later on in development, I started thinking of new features to add. After
          creating the <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a> website,
          I became interested in making a &quot;local web app&quot;. It would be
          a complete browser-based replacement for the command line app. </p>
        <p>I experimented with using Markdown conversion to create static HTML pages.
          I then created a working Flask RESTful API for manipulating entries as
          well as a very basic AngularJS web client. </p>
        <p>I eventually decided to scrap those ideas. There were an infinite number
          of features that I <em>could</em> add. However, they would all be a lot
          of work for little benefit. I realised I should focus on doing one thing
          and doing it well (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a>).
          </p>
        <p>I cleaned up the code even more and implemented a complete <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html">argparse</a>          command line parser. It ties together all the basic features of the program.
          It also adds enough documentation so that anyone could figure out how
          to use it. </p>
        <p>I did eventually adapt my previous ideas and implement a better static HTML
          generator. It allows things like pictures and videos to be embedded in
          entries. Its features slightly overlap with the basic command line functionality
          but not by as much. </p>
        <p><strong>Lesson 5:</strong> Write programs that do one thing and do it well.</p>
        <h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>
        <p>I&#39;m very proud of my current diary program. I use it literally every
          single day. If I want to find out about some event that happened two years
          ago then I can often do it in a couple of seconds. </p>
        <p>In some ways, my constant <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ultimate-dogfooding-story/">dogfooding</a>          has resulted in a very high quality program. However, in another way,
          it&#39;s probably doomed it to obscurity. The structure of the program
          is very closely tied to how I like to work. Although it&#39;s perfect
          for me, someone else might find it pointless or hard to use.</p>
        <p>For the last three years, I have kept the project to myself. I have only
          just <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/diary">uploaded it to GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>I guess time will tell whether anyone else is interested. Who knows, maybe
          it will become just as popular as <a href="http://todotxt.com/">Todo.txt</a>          but I somehow doubt that. </p>
        <p>The point I&#39;m trying to make is that I should have sought external feedback
          much earlier. The project is mostly finished now. I don&#39;t expect to
          make many major changes. If I had gotten feedback earlier in development
          then I may have learned some useful information about what others wanted
          and how to improve the project. </p>
        <p><strong>Lesson 6:</strong> Release often and early.</p>
