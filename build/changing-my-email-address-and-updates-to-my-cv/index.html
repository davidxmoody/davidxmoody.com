        <p>I have a <em>new email address</em>: <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x64;&#97;&#118;&#x69;&#100;&#x40;&#x64;&#x61;&#x76;&#x69;&#x64;&#x78;&#109;&#111;&#111;&#x64;&#x79;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#x64;&#97;&#118;&#x69;&#100;&#x40;&#x64;&#x61;&#x76;&#x69;&#x64;&#x78;&#109;&#111;&#111;&#x64;&#x79;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>
        </p>
        <p>I have been running this blog for two and a half months but was still using
          my old Gmail address. Now that I&#39;m thinking of applying for jobs,
          I want something that looks a bit more <strong>professional</strong>.
          I think my new email address makes it pretty obvious that I have my own
          personal domain. I&#39;m hoping that people will see it and think <em>&quot;I guess that guy must know what he&#39;s doing&quot;</em>.
          </p>
        <p>Setting it up was pretty easy. I&#39;m already registered with <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>          and they offer a relatively cheap email service. </p>
        <p>I did have one slight problem. I had <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody">about 800 commits on my GitHub profile</a>          with my old Gmail address. I could have left them as they were (GitHub
          allows you to associate more than one email address with your account).
          However, I don&#39;t think anyone else has cloned them yet and I wanted
          to have some degree of <em>consistency</em> across all of my public commits.
          </p>
        <p>Thankfully, GitHub provide instructions on how to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/">change author info in published repositories</a>.
          Their instructions were easy to follow and worked perfectly. </p>
        <p>I also made some minor modifications to <a href="/cv/">my CV</a>. Nothing
          major. I just showed it to my Dad who gave me a few suggestions. I also
          added some more links to other posts on this blog. <a href="/my-experiences-playing-croquet/">I wrote about croquet on Friday</a>          and added a link to it in the &quot;interests&quot; section. Croquet has
          been a pretty big part of my life recently. I didn&#39;t want to just
          say that without any <em>evidence</em> to back it up. </p>
        <p>Over the next few weeks, I plan to write about my two other major hobbies
          which I have yet to write about: cooking and photography. I have loads
          of photos to share (from both) and several interesting stories. </p>
        <p>I could have done more this week. I feel mildly guilty about it. However,
          slow progress is far better than no progress and I can live with it. I
          have plans for this week including finally adding comments to this blog
          and going to Bristol again. I&#39;ll write about that next week. </p>
