        <p><em>I&#39;m starting a blog.</em> </p>
        <p>I want to contribute something back to the world. I&#39;ve learned a lot
          over the past few years and I want to start sharing it. I may someday
          post articles about what I&#39;ve already done (or upload it to my
          <a
          href="https://github.com/davidxmoody">GitHub profile</a>). For now though, I am going to write about what I&#39;ve
            been interested in most recently: <strong>front end web development</strong>.
            </p>
        <p>You can check out <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a>          to see my last project (<a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/professorp.co.uk">GitHub repo here</a>).
          It is a website for the Professor P series of children&#39;s books and
          also includes <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/games/">five JavaScript games</a>.
          </p>
        <p>Why now? I don&#39;t feel ready to start but <a href="http://jamesclear.com/successful-people-start-before-they-feel-ready">that doesn&#39;t mean I shouldn&#39;t start anyway</a>.
          I&#39;ve spent a long time thinking about the trivial details of this
          blog. Things like what blogging platform to use and the visual style I
          want. However, I realised that none of that will ever matter if I don&#39;t
          create some decent content. I&#39;m going to keep the style as simple
          as possible and focus on the content first. </p>
        <p>I recently re-read <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step/">this excellent Coding Horror blog post</a>.
          Here is a quote:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>When people ask me for advice on blogging, I always respond with yet another
            form of the same advice: <strong>pick a schedule you can live with, and stick to it. Until you do that, none of the other advice I could give you will matter.</strong>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>My schedule will be <strong>three blog posts per week</strong>, on <em>Mondays</em>,
          <em>Wednesdays</em> and <em>Fridays</em>.</p>
        <p>I want this blog to <em>eventually</em> be great. The best way for me to
          make that happen is to practise writing good content and the best way
          for <em>that</em> to happen is to set myself a schedule. </p>
