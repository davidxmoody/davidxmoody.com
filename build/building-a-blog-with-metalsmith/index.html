          <p><em>Nov 26, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I recently transitioned this blog from <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>          to <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a>. I&#39;m glad I
          started with Jekyll but I wanted more control. I decided to switch to
          Metalsmith so that I could write my own build scripts in a language I
          knew (JavaScript). </p>
        <p>There are <em>tons</em> of excellent static site generators available. See
          <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/">staticsitegenerators.net</a>          for a list. I&#39;ve used <a href="https://docpad.org/">DocPad</a> before
          (for the <a href="http://professorp.co.uk/">professorp.co.uk</a> website).
          I chose Metalsmith because it offered the most bare-bones setup with minimal
          restrictions. </p>
        <p>This post will not be a full guide on how to use Metalsmith. I&#39;m assuming
          that anyone interested in Metalsmith is willing to get their hands dirty.
          Instead, this post will simply list some of the useful plugins I&#39;ve
          come across and some other hacks I&#39;ve made up. </p>

        <h2 id="paragraph-count">Paragraph count</h2>
        <p>In one of my very early posts, I wrote about <a href="/paragraph-counts-in-jekyll/">paragraph counts in Jekyll</a>.
          I like to have links saying <em>&quot;Read 15 remaining paragraphs...&quot;</em>          at the end of my excerpts. I think it&#39;s better than not giving any
          information on the length of an article and more useful than giving a
          raw wordcount. </p>
        <p>Jekyll was rather limited in how it could count paragraphs. I ended up using
          a pretty awkward Liquid Template hack. Thankfully JavaScript can do much
          better. Everything after the <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> tag is passed
          through the <code>paraCount()</code> function. It counts everything I
          feel qualifies as a paragraph including: <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>,
          <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>          elements.</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-js"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">paraCount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">text</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/&lt;(p|ul|ol|pre|table)&gt;[\s\S]*?&lt;\/\1&gt;/g</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

    <h2 id="post-organisation">Post organisation</h2>
    <p>I keep all my posts in pretty much the same format as I used with Jekyll. For
      example, this post has a filename of:</p>
    <pre><code class="lang-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>src/posts/2014-11-26-building-a-blog-with-metalsmith.md
</pre>
  </div>

  </code>
  </pre>
  <p>I use the handy <a href="https://github.com/sanx/metalsmith-date-in-filename">metalsmith-date-in-filename</a>    plugin to extract the dates. I also use the <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-permalinks">metalsmith-permalinks</a>    and <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-collections">metalsmith-collections</a>    plugins rename and organise posts.</p>
  <h2 id="rss-feed">RSS feed</h2>
  <p>There&#39;s a very handy <a href="https://github.com/hurrymaplelad/metalsmith-feed">metalsmith-feed</a>    plugin for generating RSS feeds from collections. </p>
  <p>It works great although I like to substitute all relative URLs with absolute ones
    so that they work correctly when viewed in an RSS reader:</p>
  <pre><code class="lang-js"><div class="highlight"><pre>  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">feed</span><span class="p">({</span>
    <span class="nx">collection</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;posts&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">limit</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">destination</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;feed.xml&#39;</span>
  <span class="p">}))</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">files</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">files</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;feed.xml&#39;</span><span class="p">];</span>
    <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">contents</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Buffer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">contents</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">toString</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/(src|href)=&quot;\//g</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;$1=&quot;http://davidxmoody.com/&#39;</span><span class="p">));</span>
  <span class="p">})</span>

  <h2 id="markdown-and-pygments">Markdown and Pygments</h2>
  <p>Jekyll uses <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a>, a syntax highlighter
    written in Python. It&#39;s pretty good and has support for tons of languages.
    It also supports the <code>console</code> language for mixing in bash prompts
    with output from commands. I use that in several of my older posts and didn&#39;t
    want to lose it. </p>
  <p>I spent <em>far too long</em> hacking together my own Markdown plugin which could
    do syntax highlighting with Pygments. I ran into a lot of problems with marked
    and Pygments. The complications arise because Pygments is an external Python
    library and thus has to be called asynchronously. Marked <em>does</em> support
    this. However, it was tricky to tie it all together. Additionally, both marked
    and Pygments add in a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> element wrapping the code and
    I had to hack together a way to get around having two <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>    elements at once.</p>
  <p>This blog is currently using Pygments but I regret it. It wasn&#39;t worth the
    effort. I&#39;m even considering going back to <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a>    for the simplicity and speed improvement.</p>
  <p>If you are dead set on using Pygments with Metalsmith then you might want to refer
    to <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/davidxmoody.github.io/blob/f79f9e9088612d5c0c6840268f1bdfb06accd53b/scripts/markdown.js">this file</a>.
    It is a modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-markdown">metalsmith-markdown</a>    plugin which handles asynchronous Pygments highlighting. </p>
  <h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/wilsaj/metalsmith-each">metalsmith-each</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-ignore">metalsmith-ignore</a>      are pretty useful</li>
    <li>I&#39;ve written about <a href="/cloudflare-and-hashed-css/">CSS file hashing</a>      in a previous post with the <a href="https://github.com/christophercliff/metalsmith-fingerprint">metalsmith-fingerprint</a>      plugin</li>
    <li>I have implemented a basic pagination setup and basic archive page, I plan on
      doing a better job and writing a full post on them later</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mayo/metalsmith-serve">metalsmith-serve</a> is a
      quick and convenient way to serve your site when testing</li>
    <li>Unfortunately metalsmith-serve doesn&#39;t work with <a href="https://github.com/FWeinb/metalsmith-watch">metalsmith-watch</a>      so I use <a href="https://github.com/remy/nodemon">nodemon</a> to watch for
      changes and rebuild the site</li>
    <li>I switched from Liquid Templates to <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
  <p>Overall, Metalsmith is great. It&#39;s <em>supposed</em> to be extremely simple
    and rely on plugins to do the heavy lifting. It accomplishes that well. I would
    happily use it for another project.</p>
  <p>My only complaint is that it doesn&#39;t do incremental builds. A small change
    in one post causes a full rebuild with my current setup. It&#39;s understandable
    why Metalsmith doesn&#39;t include this (it would be really complex). I may
    try to implement a custom solution where each individual post is only updated
    when that post changes but all other files are regenerated every time. </p>
