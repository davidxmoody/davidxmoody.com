        <p>I&#39;ve recently been uploading a lot of my old projects. Both to prove
          I&#39;ve actually done them and also in case someone might be interested.</p>
        <p>This week, I have uploaded my 3rd year Cambridge University dissertation
          project. It is a <strong>Texas Hold &#39;em poker-bot</strong> which uses
          the <strong>Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm</strong>. You can <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot">view the source on GitHub</a>.
          In this post, I am going to give a very brief summary of the project and
          make notes on how I could have done better.</p>
        <h2 id="how-to-build-a-poker-bot">How to build a poker-bot</h2>
        <p>My poker-bot runs as a plugin to <a href="http://www.poker-academy.com/poker-software/">Poker Academy Pro</a>,
          a commercial program which can run custom bots written in Java. It also
          came with a nice little example poker-bot called SimpleBot. I based most
          of my dissertation around how well my poker-bot (MCTSBot) could play against
          SimpleBot. </p>
        <p><img src="/images/mcts-in-texas-hold-em-poker-a-retrospective/PAP1-800x.png"
          alt="Screenshot of Poker Academy Pro">
        </p>
        <p>I&#39;m not going to write a complete description of the Monte Carlo Tree
          Search algorithm in this post. If you are interested, you can check out
          chapters 2.4 and 2.5 of <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot/raw/master/Dissertation.pdf">my dissertation (PDF)</a>.</p>
        <p>For now, I&#39;ll just say that it uses random simulations to gradually
          build up a partial game tree. It uses advanced strategies to find a balance
          between <em>exploring</em> new branches and <em>exploiting</em> the most
          promising branches.</p>
        <p>I discovered that a decent <strong>opponent model</strong> was vital to
          the success of the program. An opponent model helps to predict what moves
          an opponent will make and increases the accuracy of simulations. To create
          one, I used <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">Weka</a>, a
          handy set of open source machine learning algorithms. I would have loved
          to create my own machine learning algorithms but it would have been well
          beyond the scope of the project. </p>
        <p>I also spent a lot of time creating tools to extract and analyse the data.
          I even wrote a simple graphical user interface which ran beside Poker
          Academy Pro. It displayed a <em>live view</em> of the expected values
          of each possible move as it was calculating them. </p>
        <p><img src="/images/mcts-in-texas-hold-em-poker-a-retrospective/GUI.png" alt="Screenshot of my GUI">
        </p>
        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>The purpose of my dissertation was not only to build a working poker-bot
          but also to analyse its performance in different situations. Again, I
          recommend you check out chapter 4 of <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot/raw/master/Dissertation.pdf">my full dissertation (PDF)</a>          for a proper explanation. </p>
        <p>By the end of the project, my poker-bot was consistently able to beat SimpleBot.
          However, it was a tough battle to get there. The following graph shows
          MCTSBot&#39;s performance with and without the two different opponent
          models I used (<strong>H</strong>and <strong>R</strong>ank <strong>O</strong>pponent
          <strong>M</strong>odel and <strong>N</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>ove
          <strong>O</strong>pponent <strong>M</strong>odel). It shows that both
          models were required to turn a positive average profit. </p>

        </p>
        <p>I also explored how other parameters affected performance. Here is a quick
          graph of MCTSBot&#39;s performance as its thinking time is varied.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Again, this blog post really isn&#39;t meant to be a complete summary of
          the project. If you are interested, I recommend reading chapters 2 and
          4 of <a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot/raw/master/Dissertation.pdf">my full dissertation (PDF)</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="advice-for-my-past-self">Advice for my past-self</h2>
        <p>Over three terms, my time log shows that I spent about <em>300 hours</em>          on the project. I got a grade of <em>69/100</em> for my dissertation which
          I was pleased with. </p>
        <p>However, I still made plenty of mistakes. By far my biggest problem was
          <em>overconfidence</em>. I had completed almost the entire program by
          the half-way point. I thought the data collection and analysis would be
          easy. I didn&#39;t even start it until the beginning of the final term.
          </p>
        <p>Of course, it wasn&#39;t easy. It was one of the hardest and most time consuming
          parts of the project. Running simulations was a very slow process. My
          computer was probably running at max capacity for about three weeks straight.
          I did a pretty good job but I still feel that with a week extra, I could
          have gotten another 5-10 marks easily. </p>
        <p>Another thing I noticed about my dissertation is that plain English is <em>very bad</em>          for describing program structure. My project supervisor urged me to include
          some diagrams but I just ran out of time. I should have heeded his advice
          earlier and included a few really good diagrams to explain the MCTS algorithm.
          </p>
        <p>Looking through the source code, I also notice a lot of <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/code-smells/">code smells</a>.
          Things like long methods, duplicated code, commented out code and lots
          of methods which do very similar things.</p>
        <p>Looking back at it now, I do feel slightly embarrassed. It was my first
          ever major project and I didn&#39;t really know what I was doing. At least
          I know better now, at least I like to think I do :)</p>
        <p>If I could only give one piece of advice to my past-self, it would be this:
          <em>Get it done ASAP</em>. </p>
