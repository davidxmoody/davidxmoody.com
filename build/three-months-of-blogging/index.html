        <p>This will be my third monthly review. Yet again, I am going to look back
          at the last month and create a plan for the next one. </p>
        <h2 id="a-better-spread-of-topics">A better spread of topics</h2>
        <p>For the first month of this blog, I wrote mostly about programming topics.
          For the second month, I switched to writing mostly about personal topics.
          In <a href="/two-months-of-blogging/">my previous monthly review</a>,
          I noticed this. I set myself a more specific schedule in order to focus
          my writing on <em>a better spread of topics</em>.</p>
        <p>I&#39;m very pleased with every post I&#39;ve written over the last month.
          I notice that most of them were about the major experiences of my life
          so far. The reason for that is that I was in the process of writing my
          CV and realised I had no <em>evidence</em> to support my claims. Most
          of what I&#39;ve written this month was written to support the main points
          of <a href="/cv/">my CV</a>. </p>
        <h2 id="last-week">Last week</h2>
        <p>Overall, the last month has been excellent for me. However, the last week
          has been an exception. </p>
        <p>Last Monday, I wrote a <a href="/a-specific-plan-for-next-week/">specific plan</a>.
          I said I wanted to <em>&quot;Look at job ads and agencies and identify several places where I would like to work&quot;</em>.
          I also said I would do one Pomodoro on the task every day.</p>
        <p>I made it the first two days before realising that it really wasn&#39;t
          getting me anywhere. I already know the exact type of job I want (web
          development, matching my existing skills). I also know that there are
          many such jobs available. What I really need to do is get to the point
          where I can actually apply for them. </p>
        <p>There are still a few things to do before then:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Convert my CV to PDF for sending with applications</li>
          <li>Write a covering letter</li>
          <li>Make my blog more presentable (currently the good stuff is too hard to
            find and the home page isn&#39;t very helpful)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I really should have just started on the above list but instead I ran into
          another problem. That problem was <a href="http://bindingofisaac.com/">The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</a>.
          It was released Tuesday night and I&#39;ve spent <em>far too much time</em>          playing it over the last week. I managed to stick to my blogging schedule
          but I didn&#39;t get much else done. I definitely regret spending so much
          time on it. I&#39;m pleased to say that I feel like I&#39;m over it now.
          I might play it occasionally but I&#39;m not going to obsess over it like
          I have this week. </p>
        <h2 id="focus-for-next-month">Focus for next month</h2>
        <p>Last month, I mostly focused on writing about my past experiences. However,
          I&#39;ve now written about most of them. I have a few more left but not
          enough to continue for another month.</p>
        <p>The obvious focus for this month is the same as for last month: <strong>getting a job</strong>.
          I certainly made some progress last month with writing my CV and writing
          about my previous projects. I still could have done more. </p>
        <p>However, I still don&#39;t feel that writing about getting a job is really
          going to be that interesting. What I actually want to write about is <strong>programming</strong>.
          I want to continue learning about web development and then blog about
          what I learn. </p>
        <p>For the next month, my main focus will be on getting a job. However, I will
          continue to write about programming on this blog as my secondary aim.
          </p>
        <h2 id="a-new-schedule">A new schedule</h2>
        <p>For my first month, I consistently published three posts per week. For my
          second month, I went down to two and then for my third month I went back
          up to three. It has been incredibly successful for me so far but I still
          want to try something new. </p>
        <p>For the next month, I am going to publish one post every Monday (about my
          progress that week). Additionally, I will write about whatever programming
          projects I&#39;m learning about. However, I won&#39;t schedule those.
          I&#39;m going to try simply publishing them whenever it is convenient
          for me. </p>
        <p>This goes against everything that has worked for me so far. However, I think
          it could be a good move. It gives me more <em>flexibility</em> to work
          on what is most important at the time. Of course, I could be wrong and
          it could be a terrible idea. However, I&#39;m viewing it as an <strong>experiment</strong>.
          After one month, I&#39;ll see how it has gone and decide whether or not
          I want to continue. </p>
