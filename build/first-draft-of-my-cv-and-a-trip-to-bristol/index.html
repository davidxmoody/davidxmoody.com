        <p><a href="/two-months-of-blogging/">Last week</a>, I said that Mondays would
          be about my job search. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve done so far.</p>

        <h2 id="the-first-draft-of-my-cv">The first draft of my CV</h2>
        <p>Honestly, it was easier than I thought it would be. It took me 8 Pomodoros
          (3 hours 20 minutes) to plan out and write. </p>
        <p>I ended up having more to put on than I thought. However, I&#39;m still
          anxious that I don&#39;t have <em>enough</em> to show for my three years
          at home. Compared to any other recent graduate, I think I should look
          very good. However, compared to someone who graduated three years ago,
          I&#39;m not so sure. </p>
        <p>Anyway, <a href="/cv/">here is a link to my CV</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="a-trip-to-bristol">A trip to Bristol</h2>
        <p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve done any travelling by myself. Whenever
          I go anywhere, I&#39;m usually with someone who knows what they are doing.
          Applying for jobs is probably going to involve getting to a lot of interviews.
          I thought it would be a good idea to re-familiarise myself with travelling
          by bus. </p>
        <p>Last Friday, I went to Bristol on the bus (from Glastonbury). It went incredibly
          well. I found the whole experience very relaxing and not at all stressful.
          </p>
        <h2 id="getting-lost">Getting lost</h2>
        <p>Before I went, I looked at a map of Bristol. I set myself the &quot;goal&quot;
          of walking to the Clifton Suspension Bridge from the Bus Station. Approx
          35 minutes walk according to Google Maps. </p>
        <p>I decided to just set off and try to find my way there with nothing but
          my memory. In terms of actually navigating, it was a complete failure.
          I got pretty lost. I had printed out a map in case of emergencies but
          couldn&#39;t even locate myself on it because it wasn&#39;t detailed enough.
          </p>
        <p>I wondered, quite by accident, into a lovely little area called Brandon
          Hill Park. There was a tall tower with a winding staircase which I went
          up (Cabot Tower). For some reason, there were tons of ladybugs at the
          top. I spent a little while photographing them. Although I was totally
          lost, I was still having a great time. I had all day so I was happy to
          go slowly. </p>

          alt="Ladybugs at the top of Cabot Tower">
        </p>
        <p>Although I had read signposts telling me I was in Brandon Hill Park, I still
          had no idea where that was on the map. I thought I had wondered too far
          north. To find my way back, I headed towards the only major landmark I
          recognised: the river. Although it was fun just trying to use my own memory
          to navigate by, I had already been walking for over an hour and just wanted
          to get there. I figured out where I was on my map and planned a more direct
          route to the Clifton Suspension Bridge.</p>
        <p>The Bridge was a pretty awesome sight. Very high above the river. I walked
          across it and back again and then sat down and rested on a nearby bench.</p>

        </p>
        <p>I planned a more direct route back and set off. I got a sandwich to eat
          and had a brief look in the shops before catching the bus back home. </p>
        <p>A direct route to the bridge would have taken me just over an hour. However,
          I probably spent more like three and a half hours walking. </p>

        <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
        <p>Overall, I really enjoyed this trip. I&#39;m pleased with how it went. It&#39;s
          purpose was to re-introduce myself to travelling alone and in that respect
          it was a complete success. However, I realise that I can&#39;t continue
          repeating the exact same trip. I want to make things difficult for myself.
          Now that I know I can easily handle the travelling, I want to start doing
          some more challenging activities. </p>
        <p>Specifically, I want to start going to some social events. I don&#39;t know
          exactly what yet. I&#39;ve been browsing <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">meetup.com</a>          and have lots of ideas already. </p>
