        <p>I haven&#39;t written about it before but I am a very keen croquet player.
          I thought I would share some of my experiences playing in matches over
          the last few years. </p>
        <h2 id="early-introduction-to-the-game">Early introduction to the game</h2>
        <p>My Dad first introduced me to croquet when I was about 15 years old. I started
          playing in my grandparents&#39; garden with a very basic wooden mallet.
          I enjoyed it a lot. </p>

        <h2 id="abbey-croquet-club">Abbey Croquet Club</h2>
        <p>Around 2005, the Abbey Croquet Club formed in Glastonbury Abbey. My Dad
          went along and encouraged me to go. I enjoyed it and was persuaded to
          play in two matches. The first was at home, I think I won all of my games
          and was very pleased. Unfortunately, the second match was away (at Wells)
          and I lost all of my games. </p>
        <p>I think that second match really shattered my confidence. I stopped playing
          croquet for quite a while. I didn&#39;t play at Cambridge even though
          I could have. </p>
        <h2 id="abbey-croquet-club-again">Abbey Croquet Club again</h2>
        <p>When I graduated from university and came back home, I re-joined the club.
          It had moved from Glastonbury Abbey to Street (but kept the name). I played
          with my Dad and his friends for a while. </p>
        <p>I then entered an inter-club tournament. I was starting to play well at
          that point and came in second place. That really boosted my confidence.
          I decided to buy my own mallet that year.</p>
        <h2 id="first-year-of-matches">First year of matches</h2>
        <p>In 2012, I started playing in matches again. I was very nervous. Thankfully,
          my first match of the season went very well. My Dad and I won our first
          two doubles games together which put me in good spirits. I then proceeded
          to win one and lose one game on my own. I felt like I had played well
          so I was content. </p>
        <p>I should also mention that I started off playing with a handicap of 6 (minimum
          is 0 and maximum is 12). In the matches we were playing, the higher handicapped
          player gets a number of &quot;free shots&quot; equal to the difference
          in handicaps. It&#39;s a relatively fair way of balancing games.</p>
        <p>I played in 4 matches that year. Out of my 12 singles games, I won 8, lost
          2 and drew 2. I was very pleased with that. I was also improving constantly
          because of all the practice. </p>
        <h2 id="second-year-of-matches">Second year of matches</h2>
        <p>My second year of matches went very well. Our team practised together <em>constantly</em>          and we all improved a lot. We won most of our matches and reached the
          semi-final and then the final. We won the South West Handicap League for
          the first time ever. In that year, I won 21, lost 11 and drew 4. My handicap
          dropped to a 4.</p>

        <h2 id="association-croquet">Association croquet</h2>
        <p>I should mention that all references to &quot;croquet&quot; so far have
          referring to &quot;golf croquet&quot;. There is another variation on the
          game called &quot;association croquet&quot;. I started playing association
          croquet that year. My Dad had taught me the basics a while ago and my
          golf croquet skills transferred across nicely. </p>
        <p>I started playing in matches about half way through the season. I was nervous
          at the beginning but picked it up very quickly. That year, we won the
          South West Intermediate League for the first time ever.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2 id="third-year-of-matches">Third year of matches</h2>
        <p>After being in the winning team twice, my confidence had gone up considerably.
          I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an exaggeration to say I was the best golf
          croquet player in our club. I had a lower handicap than almost everyone
          else I was playing. </p>
        <p>Additionally, there was a new rule that year. It meant that lower handicap
          players (like myself) had to give away even more free shots than normal.
          Despite the additional difficulty, I had my best season yet. I won 24
          games and only lost 5. I also dropped to a 2 handicap.</p>
        <p>Our whole team practised together a lot and improved even more. We also
          got a new team member. For the second year in a row, we won the South
          West Handicap League.</p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.centralsomersetgazette.co.uk/Abbey-Croquet-Club-triumph-South-West-Handicap/story-23184624-detail/story.html"><img src="/images/my-experiences-playing-croquet/taunton-final.jpg" alt="Abbey winning the Golf Handicap League in Taunton">
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>Our association croquet team also continued to improve. That year, we won
          the South West Federation League. </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.centralsomersetgazette.co.uk/Abbey-Croquet-Club-win-South-West-Federation/story-23026871-detail/story.html"><img src="/images/my-experiences-playing-croquet/cheltenham-final.jpg"
            alt="Abbey winning the AC Federation League in Taunton">
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>If I&#39;m being completely honest, I was improving faster than my handicap
          was dropping. Association croquet games are longer than golf croquet games
          so you play fewer of them in a season. That meant my handicap was lagging
          behind my actual skill level. I do feel a bit guilty about that. Next
          year I plan to ask an official handicapper to drop my handicap to a more
          realistic level. </p>
        <h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, the croquet season has ended. We still play on weekends but
          it&#39;s too cold and dark to play in the evenings. I am also planning
          to move away from Glastonbury soon so things must change. </p>
        <p>Next year, I plan to play in tournaments as well as club matches. I&#39;m
          also thinking of upgrading my mallet and altering my technique. I still
          want to play in matches for Abbey but I am also planning to join a new
          club.</p>
        <p>I don&#39;t know what the future will hold. Croquet is important to me but
          it is not my highest priority. One of the unfortunate things about croquet
          is that most players are much older than me. According to the <a href="https://www.croquet.org.uk/ca/">2012 survey of croquet players</a>,
          the median age is 65. Only 1% of croquet players are in their 20s. </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, I plan to keep playing croquet for a long time to come. It&#39;s
          a great game. </p>
