          <h1>Better Vim abbreviations</h1>
          <p><em>Aug 27, 2014</em>
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>I&#39;ve been using Vim, full-time, for nearly three years. I have written
          <em>a lot</em> of plain text in that time. </p>
        <p>Pretty early on, I noticed I was wasting a lot of time with several common
          typing patterns. For example, to type &quot;I&#39;ve&quot; requires 5
          key strokes including two stretches of the little fingers. I replaced
          that with the abbreviation <code>iab iv I&#39;ve</code>. That&#39;s only
          two keys instead of five and it doesn&#39;t put any unnecessary stress
          on the little fingers (which I sometimes have problems with). </p>
        <p>I created several other abbreviations for common typing patterns (mostly
          avoiding having to type apostrophes and capital letters). Here is a small
          sample:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-vim"><div class="highlight"><pre>iab <span class="k">i</span> I
iab iv I&#39;<span class="k">ve</span>
iab <span class="k">il</span> I&#39;<span class="k">ll</span>
iab dont don&#39;<span class="k">t</span>
iab youtube YouTube
iab monday Monday
iab february February
iab cof CoffeeScript
</pre>
    </div>

    </code>
    </pre>
    <p>I keep these English-only abbreviations in a separate file (<code>~/.vim/abbreviations.vim</code>)
      which gets sourced when editing Markdown or text files. </p>
    <p>Some people also like to add common typos to their list of abbreviations. I
      have a few of those but I like to keep them to a minimum. When possible, I
      prefer to force myself to re-type the word correctly so that I learn the proper
      spelling. </p>
    <h2 id="annoyances">Annoyances</h2>
    <p>This worked well for me for a long time but it had two problems that kept bugging
      me. One was that I had to manually add the capitalized versions of all my
      abbreviations. For example, <code>iab cant can&#39;t</code> as well as <code>iab Cant Can&#39;t</code>.
      This duplication of information was annoying and felt messy. </p>
    <p>The other problem was that it was a pain to add new abbreviations. I had to
      manually open up my abbreviations file every time. </p>
    <p>I was about to start creating my own script to deal with this stuff. Thankfully,
      one already exists. </p>
    <h2 id="abolish-plugin">Abolish plugin</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish">Vim Abolish plugin</a> is
      pretty neat. Read the tutorial for a full walkthrough of the features. It
      lets you do stuff like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="lang-vim"><div class="highlight"><pre>Abolish seperate separate
<span class="c">&quot; Results in:</span>
iabbrev seperate separate
iabbrev Seperate Separate
iabbrev SEPERATE SEPARATE
</pre>
  </div>

  </code>
  </pre>
  <p>It has more advanced features which allow you to group together related words:</p>
  <pre><code class="lang-vim"><div class="highlight"><pre>Abolish <span class="k">cal</span>{<span class="k">a</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="k">e</span>}nder{<span class="p">,</span><span class="k">s</span>} <span class="k">cal</span>{<span class="k">e</span>}ndar{}
</pre>
  </div>

  </code>
  </pre>
  <p>Also, if you place a <code>!</code> at the end, you can add words to you abbreviations
    file easily:</p>
  <pre><code class="lang-vim"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">&quot; In ~/.vim/abbreviations.vim (or where-ever you like)</span>

<span class="c">&quot; `expand(&#39;&lt;sfile&gt;:p&#39;)` gets the absolute path of the </span>
<span class="c">&quot; current file that this is being executed from</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">g</span>:abolish_save_file <span class="p">=</span> expand<span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;&lt;sfile&gt;:p&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">!</span>exists<span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;:Abolish&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">finish</span>
<span class="k">endif</span>

<span class="c">&quot; Typing `:Abolish! im I&#39;m` will append the following</span>
<span class="c">&quot; to the end of this file:</span>
Abolish <span class="nb">im</span> I&#39;<span class="k">m</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  </code>
  </pre>
  <p>There is also a <code>Subvert</code> command for doing similar things in search
    and replace:</p>
  <pre><code class="lang-vim"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">&quot; Will replace &quot;Facilities&quot; with &quot;Buildings&quot;, etc.</span>
<span class="p">:</span>%Subvert<span class="sr">/facilit{y,ies}/</span>building{<span class="p">,</span><span class="k">s</span>}/<span class="k">g</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  </code>
  </pre>
  <p>Again, check the <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish">GitHub repo</a>    for more details. I haven&#39;t been using the plugin for long but I really
    like it so far. </p>
