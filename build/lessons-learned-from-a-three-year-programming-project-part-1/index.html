        <p>For the last three years, I have been working on a little pet project. It
          has probably taught me more about software development than my entire
          time at university. </p>
        <p>It&#39;s a command line program for writing and organising a personal diary
          (<a href="https://github.com/davidxmoody/diary">GitHub link</a>). I&#39;ve
          spent hundreds of hours on it and have gone through many different designs.
          Instead of covering every little detail of the project, I&#39;m going
          to write about some important lessons it has taught me. </p>
        <!--more-->

        <h2 id="bash-is-really-powerful">Bash is really powerful</h2>
        <p>I started keeping a diary about four years ago. Initially, I just wrote
          in a single text file. It was nice and simple and easy. After a few months,
          the file got a bit big and it was impossible to find anything. I experimented
          with splitting it into multiple files but that just made the problem worse.</p>
        <p>Then, three years ago, I started learning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell">Bash</a>).
          Bash is incredibly powerful. I take it for granted now. At the time, something
          as simple as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grepping</a>          for keywords in multiple files was a revelation. </p>
        <p>I started experimenting with all kinds of ad-hoc scripts. I had a script
          to search for keywords, a script to do a wordcount and a script to create
          new entries. I eventually settled on a new file format with one file per
          entry and the date embedded in the filename. </p>
        <p>All this time, I was learning about some incredibly useful command line
          tools:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>grep</code> to search</li>
          <li><code>less</code> to display results</li>
          <li><code>wc</code> to do a wordcount</li>
          <li><code>vim</code> to edit entries</li>
          <li><code>date</code> to format and parse dates</li>
          <li><code>fmt</code> to wrap text</li>
          <li>And many more...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, my scripts just kept growing and growing. They reached about 800
          lines of code at their maximum. There was a lot of repeated code and other
          poor design decisions. </p>
        <p>I used many elaborate work-arounds to attempt to fix some of the problems
          with Bash. However, the lack of proper data-structures really hurt. So
          did the inability to properly share information between scripts. </p>
        <p>Although I don&#39;t regret starting off with Bash, I should have realised
          that it just wasn&#39;t suitable for such a large project. </p>
        <p><strong>Lesson 1:</strong> Choose the right language for the job. </p>
        <h2 id="version-control">Version control</h2>
        <p>My very early attempts were a <em>complete mess</em>. I had scripts stored
          in multiple different directories and dotfiles and my changes frequently
          broke stuff.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, I found this <a href="http://hginit.com/">excellent Hg Init tutorial</a>.
          Even though I&#39;m now switching to <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>,
          I still love <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>. I
          learned the basics and continuously practised them. </p>
        <p>Although I had <em>technically</em> been using Mercurial in university,
          it had always been a chore. I felt like it was something I was supposed
          to do and I used it grudgingly. This time, I actually understood what
          was going on and enjoyed using it. </p>
        <p>Even though I was using version control, I was still making one big mistake.
          I was directly symlinking to my scripts for everyday use. This meant that
          whenever I was in the process of making changes, I completely broke my
          ability to use my diary normally. </p>
        <p>One particular incident really opened my eyes. I was in the process of changing
          the file storage format. I was changing each file to be stored in a month-based
          subdirectory as opposed to one big directory. I had manually migrated
          my data to the new format and was in the process of re-writing my scripts.
          </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, it took rather longer than expected. For almost a week, I
          had to manually type in the filenames for new entries. This taught me
          to separate my wild refactoring attempts from my working stable scripts.
          It also taught me to keep a separate set of &quot;test entries&quot; for
          use with that development branch. </p>
        <p>I eventually read <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Source-Control-Done-Right.aspx">this great article on source control</a>.
          I adopted the &quot;branching by exception&quot; strategy and haven&#39;t
          looked back since. </p>
        <p><strong>Lesson 2:</strong> Keep development and stable branches separate.</p>
        <h2 id="python-is-awesome">Python is awesome</h2>
        <p>My Bash scripts were becoming unwieldy. I was interested in learning a new
          programming language and Python 3 seemed perfect. For a short while, I
          was completely obsessed with Python. I read everything I could and practised
          on <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> problems. </p>
        <p>I slowly started re-writing my Bash scripts one at a time. Once I had removed
          all traces of Bash, I switched to a proper Python module design. I made
          countless changes over a long period of time. I loved all the features
          of Python which Bash didn&#39;t have (like <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators">generators</a>,
          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/modules.html">modules</a>          and proper <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/classes.html">classes</a>).</p>
        <p>I noticed that a lot of duplicated work was being done when formatting entries.
          The text wrapping had to be re-calculated every time. I had recently read
          about Python <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/739654/how-can-i-make-a-chain-of-function-decorators-in-python/1594484#1594484">decorators</a>          and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/pickle.html">pickle</a>          module. I naively tried to use them to solve the problem.</p>
        <p>I designed a very elaborate caching decorator function. It took a long time
          to write and debug but it did work. However, I had made a big error in
          judgement. For the text wrapping, I had inherited the rather lazy design
          of calling the <code>fmt</code> command line program from within Python.
          This was very slow. I later implemented text wrapping with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/textwrap.html">textwrap</a>          module which was about an order of magnitude faster. </p>
        <p>With the faster text wrapping method, my caching was now <em>slower</em>          than re-wrapping the text each time. I didn&#39;t like to do it but I
          eventually stripped out all caching behaviour, making the basic display
          functionality nearly instant. At least I had learned how to use decorators
          and the pickle module. </p>
        <p><strong>Lesson 3:</strong> Premature optimisation is bad.</p>
