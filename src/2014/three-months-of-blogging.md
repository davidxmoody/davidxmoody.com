This will be my third monthly review. Yet again, I am going to look back at the last month and create a plan for the next one.

## A better spread of topics

For the first month of this blog, I wrote mostly about programming topics. For the second month, I switched to writing mostly about personal topics. In [my previous monthly review](/two-months-of-blogging/), I noticed this. I set myself a more specific schedule in order to focus my writing on *a better spread of topics*.

I'm very pleased with every post I've written over the last month. I notice that most of them were about the major experiences of my life so far. The reason for that is that I was in the process of writing my CV and realised I had no *evidence* to support my claims. Most of what I've written this month was written to support the main points of [my CV](/cv/). 

## Last week

Overall, the last month has been excellent for me. However, the last week has been an exception. 

Last Monday, I wrote a specific plan. I said I wanted to *"Look at job ads and agencies and identify several places where I would like to work"*. I also said I would do one Pomodoro on the task every day.

I made it the first two days before realising that it really wasn't getting me anywhere. I already know the exact type of job I want (web development, matching my existing skills). I also know that there are many such jobs available. What I really need to do is get to the point where I can actually apply for them. 

There are still a few things to do before then:

1. Convert my CV to PDF for sending with applications
2. Write a covering letter
3. Make my blog more presentable (currently the good stuff is too hard to find and the home page isn't very helpful)

I really should have just started on the above list but instead I ran into another problem. That problem was **The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth**. It was released Tuesday night and I've spent *far too much time* playing it over the last week. I managed to stick to my blogging schedule but I didn't get much else done. I definitely regret spending so much time on it. I'm pleased to say that I feel like I'm over it now. I might play it occasionally but I'm not going to obsess over it like I have this week. 

## Focus for next month

Last month, I mostly focused on writing about my past experiences. However, I've now written about most of them. I have a few more left but not enough to continue for another month.

The obvious focus for this month is the same as for last month: **getting a job**. I certainly made some progress last month with writing my CV and writing about my previous projects. I still could have done more. 

However, I still don't feel that writing about getting a job is really going to be that interesting. What I actually want to write about is **programming**. I want to continue learning about web development and then blog about what I learn. 

For the next month, my main focus will be on getting a job. However, I will continue to write about programming on this blog as my secondary aim. 

## A new schedule

For my first month, I consistently published three posts per week. For my second month, I went down to two and then for my third month I went back up to three. It has been incredibly successful for me so far but I still want to try something new. 

For the next month, I am going to publish one post every Monday (about my progress that week). Additionally, I will write about whatever programming projects I'm learning about. However, I won't schedule those. I'm going to try simply publishing them whenever it is convenient for me. 

This goes against everything that has worked for me so far. However, I think it could be a good move. It gives me more *flexibility* to work on what is most important at the time. Of course, I could be wrong and it could be a terrible idea. However, I'm viewing it as an **experiment**. After one month, I'll see how it has gone and decide whether or not I want to continue.
