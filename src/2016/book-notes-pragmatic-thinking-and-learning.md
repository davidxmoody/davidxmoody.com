These are some rough notes from reading through [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](https://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning).

- To be "pragmatic" in this context essentially means to do what works for you
- Some things will work for some people and not for others
- Quote: "Only dead fish go with the flow"
- Books like this only meant to be a starting point, not definitive methods
