## Experience

### Software Engineer at Momentum Financial Technology (March&nbsp;2015 - August 2017)

I joined as the only engineer on a project to redesign a consumer finance website. I worked closely with the designers in an agile cross-functional team.

- I created a new **static site** (built with Metalsmith/Gulp/Handlebars) and set up a cloud-based CMS (Prismic)
- It included several small financial tools/calculators built with **React**

I created a life-insurance quote comparison tool using a third party API.

- It included a complex form, results view, lightweight proxy backend and basic Intercom integration
- Built with **React**, **Redux** and **Sass**
- I implemented my own version of Redux and later gave a talk on Redux at **BristolJS**

I created an "investment options tool" for helping first-time investors decide what to do.

- I later gave a lightning talk on the project at **BristolJS**, [watch the video here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YWRDk3_ATM)
- It visualised the decision tree as a literal graph on the page and could zoom in/out and pan around as the user progressed
- Built with **React**, **Redux**, **SVG** and some basic maths for zooming/panning
- I learned a lot about high-performance animation techniques

I switched to a larger team of developers helping to build a single-page **Redux** app. It was made to help financial advisers share information with their clients ([Moneyhub Connect](https://www.moneyhub.com/business/)).

- My team did significant work developing new UI components
- I introduced two big new technologies into the project: **CSS modules** (to replace Sass) and [React Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) (a tool for developing components in isolation)
- We also worked to integrate the search feature of a third party financial adviser database, I communicated with their team (over Slack) to figure out requirements

The company went through a restructure and I temporarily moved back to the original team.

- Migrated an old site to a new domain (**yourwealth.co.uk** to **momentum.co.uk**, neither are still online)
- Converted the entire project from CoffeeScript to JavaScript and changed hosting from Amazon S3 to Netlify
- Helped hire two new developers

I moved back to the other side of the business to work on the consumer app [Moneyhub](https://www.moneyhub.com/). It was another large single-page **React**/**Flux** app.

- We started off with a 5-day [Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/) to try to figure out how to get new users engaged with the app
- We implemented a major new feature: an animated homescreen with "nudges" to give insights about the user's data
- I worked with many back-end **microservices** (with **Docker**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **Postgres** and **Mongo**)
- I implemented a lightweight server for email verification and password resets (with **Express** and **Nunjucks**)
- Experience with **functional programming** (using Ramda)
- Experience with **TDD** (using Mocha)
- Experience writing **UI tests** (with the PioneerJS framework and Cucumber syntax)

The app was previously bundled with Cordova but an effort had already been made to migrate to a lightweight **React Native** wrapper. The iOS build worked but the Android one did not. The project was based on a very old React Native bootstrap project and needed significant work.

- I got it working and released it to the Google Play Store
- Implemented a system for building the Android app in multiple different white-labelled versions (with Gradle)
- Integrated the AppsFlyer SDK (an analytics platform) and added server-side event tracking

I went with five other people from the company to take part in the 2-day [Pensions Dashboard Techsprint](https://twitter.com/MoneyhubEnterpr/status/852439989791150080) event in London (run by the HM Treasury).

- We worked for two days to create a new prototype for the upcoming pensions dashboard
- We had also previously held an internal 3-day Design Sprint based around visualising pension data (I created some interactive graphs inspired by [Bret Victor's Ladder of Abstraction](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/))

I also took an interest in our Git repositories while working at the company.

- I created a project that gathered all of the package.json files from all of our repos (using BitBucket's API) and could tell you which projects depended on which other ones
- I introduced [fit-commit](https://github.com/m1foley/fit-commit) to the team (a Ruby tool for validating Git commit messages) and later ported it to JavaScript so that it could be more easily automated (using an npm Git hook tool called [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky))

## Meetups and conferences

I have attended, helped out and given talks at a lot of local Bristol tech meetups over the last few years:

- In April 2016, I gave a lightening talk at **BristolJS** demonstrating my zoomable investment tool ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YWRDk3_ATM))
- In July 2016, I gave a full talk at **BristolJS** on Redux ([slides](http://slides.com/davidmoody/redux#/))

- I've been to a lot of other meetups in Bristol including **Bristech**, **Bristol Web Perf** and more
- I went to the [Simpleweb Future of Chat hack day](https://simpleweb.co.uk/hacking-the-future-of-chat-at-the-simpleweb-challenge-with-twilio-pusher-and-marvel/) (and won a prize for my Slack-based Git chatbot)
