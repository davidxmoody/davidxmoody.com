## Experience

### Software Engineer at Momentum Financial Technology (March 2015 - present)

Joined as the sole engineer on a project to redesign a consumer finance website (yourwealth.co.uk).

- Worked in a small team with designers, content writers and a digital marketer for three months
- Created a new **static site** (built with Metalsmith/Gulp/Handlebars) and set up a cloud-based CMS (Prismic)
- It had 150+ articles, 100+ guides and many other content types
- Worked on various small financial tools/calculators built with **React**
- Worked with the designers to create the **Sass** styles for the site

Created a life-insurance quote comparison tool using a third party API.

- It consisted of a complex form, results view, lightweight proxy backend and basic Intercom integration
- Built with **React**, **Redux** and **Sass**

Created an "investment options tool" for helping first-time investors decide what to do.

- Featuring a force-graph based layout and "zoomable UI"
- Built with **React**, **Redux**, **SVG** and some basic maths for zooming/panning
- Learned a lot about high-performance animation techniques
- I later gave a lightning talk on the project at **BristolJS**, [watch the video here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YWRDk3_ATM)

Switched to another team of developers helping to build a large single-page **Redux** app. It was made to help financial advisers share information with their clients ([Moneyhub Connect](https://www.moneyhub.com/business/)).

- My team did significant work to improve the existing Bootstrap UI
- I introduced two big new technologies into the project: **CSS modules** (to replace Sass) and [React Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) (a dev tool)
- We also worked to integrate the search feature of a third party financial adviser database, I communicated extensively with their team (over Slack) to figure out requirements

The company went through a restructure and I temporarily moved back to the original team.

- Migrated **yourwealth.co.uk** to a new domain [momentum.co.uk](https://www.momentum.co.uk/) and updated branding
- Converted the entire project from CoffeeScript to JavaScript and changed hosting from Amazon S3 to Netlify
- Also helped hire two new developers

Moved back to the other side of the business to work on the consumer app [Moneyhub](https://www.moneyhub.com/). It was another large single-page **React**/**Flux** app.

- We started off with a 5-day [Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/) to try and figure out how to get new users engaged with the app
- We implemented a major new feature: a new homescreen with "nudges" to give insights about the user's data
- We spent time implementing new features, improving existing ones and fixing bugs
- Also spent some time working on our backend code (**Docker**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **Postgres** and **Mongo**)
- Experience writing **UI tests** (with the PioneerJS framework and Cucumber syntax)
- Lots of experience with functional programming (using **Ramda**)

The business strategy changed, we switched from selling our app to consumers to selling a white-labelled version of our app to enterprises.

- I implemented a lightweight server for rendering brand-aware pages for email verification and password changes
- Implemented with **Express** and **Nunjucks**

The app was previously bundled with Cordova but an effort had already been made to migrate to a lightweight **React Native** wrapper. The iOS build worked but the Android one did not. The project was based on a very old React Native bootstrap project and needed significant work.

- I got it working and released it to the Google Play Store
- Implemented a system for building the Android app in multiple different white-labelled versions
- Integrated the AppsFlyer SDK (an analytics platform) and added server-side event tracking

I went with five other people from the company to take part in the 2-day [Pensions Dashboard Techsprint](https://twitter.com/MoneyhubEnterpr/status/852439989791150080) event in London (run by the HM Treasury).

- We worked for two days to create a new prototype for the upcoming pensions dashboard
- We had also previously held an internal 3-day Design Sprint based around visualising pension data (I created some interactive graphs inspired by [Bret Victor's Ladder of Abstraction](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/))

I also took an interest in our Git repositories while working at the company.

- I created a project that gathered all of the package.json files from all of our repos (using BitBucket's API) and could tell you which projects depended on which other ones
- I introduced [fit-commit](https://github.com/m1foley/fit-commit) to the team (a Ruby tool for validating Git commit messages) and later ported it to JavaScript so that it could be more easily automated (using an npm Git hook tool called [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky))

## Meetups and conferences

I have attended and helped out at a lot of local Bristol tech meetups over the last two years:

- I've been to a lot of other meetups in Bristol including **Bristech**, **Bristol Web Perf** and more
