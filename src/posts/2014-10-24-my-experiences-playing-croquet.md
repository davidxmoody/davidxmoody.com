I haven't written about it before but I am a very keen croquet player. I thought I would share some of my experiences playing in matches over the last few years. 


## Early introduction to the game

My Dad first introduced me to croquet when I was about 15 years old. I started playing in my grandparents' garden with a very basic wooden mallet.

## Abbey Croquet Club

Around 2005, the Abbey Croquet Club formed in Glastonbury Abbey. My Dad went along and encouraged me to go. I enjoyed it and was persuaded to play in two matches. The first went very well but the second went very badly. I stopped playing for a while after that. I didn't play at Cambridge even though I could have. 

## Abbey Croquet Club again

After university, I re-joined the club. It had moved from Glastonbury Abbey to Street (but kept the name). I played with my Dad and his friends for a while. 

We then had an inter-club tournament. I was starting to play well at that point and came in second place. That really boosted my confidence. I bought my own mallet that year.

## First year of matches

In 2012, I started playing in matches again. I was very nervous. Thankfully, my first few matches went well and everyone was very friendly.

I started off playing with a handicap of 6 (minimum is 0 and maximum is 12). In the matches we were playing, the higher handicapped player gets a number of "free shots" equal to the difference in handicaps. It's a relatively fair way of balancing games.

I played in 4 matches that year. Out of my 12 singles games, I won 8, lost 2 and drew 2. I was improving steadily because of all the practice. 

## Second year of matches

My second year of matches went very well. Our team practised together *constantly* and we all improved a lot. We won most of our matches and reached the semi-final and then the final. We won the South West Handicap League for the first time ever. In that year, I won 21, lost 11 and drew 4. My handicap dropped to a 4.

## Association croquet

I should mention that all references to "croquet" so far have referring to "golf croquet". There is another variation on the game called "association croquet". I started playing association croquet that year. My Dad had taught me the basics a while ago and my golf croquet skills transferred across nicely. 

I started playing in matches about half way through the season. I was nervous at the beginning but picked it up very quickly. That year, we won the South West Intermediate League for the first time ever.

## Third year of matches

After being in the winning team twice, my confidence had gone up considerably. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say I was the best golf croquet player in our club. I had a lower handicap than almost everyone else I was playing. 

Additionally, there was a new rule that year. It meant that lower handicap players (like myself) had to give away even more free shots than normal. Despite the additional difficulty, I had my best season yet. I won 24 games and only lost 5. I also dropped to a 2 handicap.

Our whole team frequently practised together and we improved even more. We also got a new team member. For the second year in a row, we won the South West Handicap League.

Our association croquet team also continued to improve. That year, we won the South West Federation League.

## Future plans

Unfortunately, the croquet season has ended. We still play on weekends but it's too cold and dark to play in the evenings. I am also planning to move away from Glastonbury soon so things must change. 

Next year, I hope to play in tournaments as well as club matches. I'm also thinking of upgrading my mallet and altering my technique. I still want to play in matches for Abbey but I am also planning to join a new club.

I plan to keep playing croquet for a long time to come. It's a great game.
