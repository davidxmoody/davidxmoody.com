title: "The Pomodoro Technique: What I wish I'd known"

Let me tell you how I came to write this blog post. I have been using the Pomodoro Technique for over a year. I was using a web-based timer but felt I was due for an upgrade. I wanted a command line app.

However, in my research, I learned a lot more than I thought I would. My opinion has changed on what's truly important. I only wish I had realised this sooner. 


## A look back

I first tried the [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) In June 2013. The idea is simple. Set a timer and focus on one task until it runs out. **I absolutely loved it.**

When I first started, I needed a tool to time myself. I quickly found [Tomatoes](http://tomato.es/). It's a free and [open source](https://github.com/potomak/tomatoes) web app. After a year of use, I'm still pretty pleased with it. It does all the important stuff. It has a timer, audible alerts and the ability to visualise past performance. 

If you are interested, here is a [link to my Tomatoes profile](http://tomato.es/users/51bb385849f9a801320000ec). I've completed 702 tomatoes as of the time of writing. I am pleased with that but I know I could have done better. 

The biggest "problem" is that I lacked consistency. My graph is nothing but a series of spikes. 8 tomatoes one day, 0 the next, 7 the next, 0 the next. I didn't realise why this was happening until recently. 

## I missed the most important part

That brings me back to this blog post. While researching it, I read [Pomodoro Technique Illustrated](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pomodoro-Technique-Illustrated-Pragmatic-Life-ebook/dp/B00A376NI8). It's a good book (although most of the information is available elsewhere too). 

What was the reason for my inconsistent spikes? **My planning sucked.**

I was having great success with the 25-5 cycle but that wasn't enough. I did not get into the habit of creating strong plans. I never prioritised enough or made them specific enough. This caused me to waste too much time on the wrong things. I felt like I was "stuck" and lost motivation to continue. 

Here is a specific example. When I started putting together the [professorp.co.uk](http://professorp.co.uk/) website, I spent ages struggling with the CSS. I tried to create my own responsive layout from scratch (with no previous experience doing similar things). It was really hard. I hated it and wanted to quit. Eventually, I realised that the reason I hated it was that I was working on the wrong thing. Perfectly aligned CSS was not important to the project as a whole. I ended up switching to Bootstrap and got on with making the site. 

So, what should I have done? Basically, I should have followed the *actual* Pomodoro Technique much more closely. 

1. Plan
2. Get stuff done and track it
3. Review daily progress

I used to think that having Tomatoes track everything was good enough. I realise now that tracking is useless unless you look back at the data and process it. I'm getting better at planning but still need to work on reviewing. 

## Tools don't really matter

It's obvious but also hard to internalise. I think everyone falls into the same trap. You think, "Maybe this *next* todo app will make me more productive". But no, it never works like that. 

The original Pomodoro Technique recommends sticking to the simplest tools possible. Just paper and a simple kitchen timer. I respect that now.

## What does matter?

I think the most important part of the Pomodoro Technique (and of *any* productivity system) is the [Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA). That is, creating a prioritised plan, doing it, reviewing how it went and using that information to improve your next plan. 

Having said that, I also really like the 25 minutes of focus, 5 minutes of rest cycle. I've been using it for so long that I think I take it for granted. Taking frequent rests and focusing completely can build significant momentum. I've just got to make sure I point that momentum in the right direction. 

If you are interested in the Pomodoro Technique, I highly recommend it. This blog post is hardly meant to be a comprehensive introduction. The [official website](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) is a good place to get started. The [Pomodoro Technique Illustrated](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pomodoro-Technique-Illustrated-Pragmatic-Life-ebook/dp/B00A376NI8) ebook is also very good. I also still like [Tomatoes](http://tomato.es/).
