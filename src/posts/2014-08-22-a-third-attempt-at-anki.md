title: A third attempt at Anki
---

I first found out about [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) ages ago. Probably about four years ago on [LessWrong](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Spaced_repetition). It's a flashcard program which makes remembering things easier. 

A lot of smart people had said a lot of good things about Anki. That made me want to try it. However, I have yet to stick with it successfully. 


## My first attempt

About three years ago, I decided to give it a try. At the time, I wanted to learn the Java standard library better. I remember installing it and looking for shared decks. There were quite a lot but most were not very good. It felt like most were created by students taking "Introduction to Java" classes. Despite that, I downloaded them anyway. I tried to use them but I lost interest pretty quickly.

Shortly after, I abandoned Anki for the first time. I feel the mistakes I made here are pretty obvious:

- Most of the cards were either too easy, too trivial or just not useful
- I did not *fully* understand the content of the Anki cards before trying to learn from them
- Although I made a few of my own cards, I never got into the *habit* of making them

## My second attempt

About a year and a half ago, I wanted to try it again. I had learned from my previous attempt. I knew that I had to make my own cards instead of using existing ones. 

I got into the habit of finding a tutorial on a subject I wanted to learn about and writing notes on the important points. I would then go through my notes and make Anki cards. 

This worked better than before but it didn't last. Although I stuck with it for a good few months, the approach still had many problems:

- I wasted too much time trying to make the cards look pretty (e.g. surrounding all code in `<code>` tags)
- I found that when reading "introductory" tutorials, my cards were often too basic and should have been combined into a smaller number of cards
- I only created cards in designated study sessions and never when I was in the middle of programming

## This time will be different

I'm determined to get Anki to work for me. I have read many good things about it and I believe it could be great if only I could start using it better. 

I recently found [this article by someone who has created 10,000 Anki cards](http://rs.io/2014/04/05/Anki-10000-cards-later.html). I recommend reading it but here is the advice I took from it:

- "Why" questions are more important than memorising facts (this feels obvious yet all my previous efforts had been focused on creating factual cards)
- Don't just create one-way connections, sometimes you need to remember something when given different prompts
- There is no need to create multiple decks, one massive deck is just fine
- Images can be better than plain text

## Some guidelines for myself

Specifically, here is what I plan to do:

- Review *every single day* and [whenever it is most convenient for myself](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition#when-to-review)
- Make an Anki card whenever I learn something [worth remembering](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition#how-much-to-add)
- Avoid creating too many purely factual cards or cards with little value
- Use a single massive deck and sync it with my Android phone

I could write more about this but I think I just need to start. I will create another post in a month or so with my progress.
