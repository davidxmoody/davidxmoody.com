    <p><strong>I want to become a better writer.</strong> According to the <a href="/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/">growth mindset</a>, I know that this is achievable through <em>hard work and practice</em>. I have to consistently put in the time and effort and I will slowly get better. </p>

<p>I knew that when I first started this blog. I set myself a schedule for publishing blog posts and have stuck to it ever since. <em>This has worked brilliantly.</em> But, it also has a few problems. Although I’ve never missed a post, I have procrastinated more than I would like. This last week in particular, my writing has suffered because of it.</p>

    <h1>Writing speeds</h1>
    <p class="meta">Oct 2, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I like to write a lot. I usually write for about 2-4 hours per day. For something I do so much of, there are incredible time savings to be had. Of course, writing fast is only a very small part of being a good writer. Nevertheless, these small gains add up. The less time I spend writing, the more time I can spend thinking.</p>

    <h1>100 push ups: the ultimate slow gains experiment</h1>
    <p class="meta">Sep 29, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I have recently written about the <a href="/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/">growth mindset</a>. When you have a growth mindset, you believe that your basic abilities can be improved with hard work and practice. </p>

<p>There are plenty things in my life I want to improve. However, I’m going to start with exercise. I’ve previously tried and failed to form exercise habits. None of my attempts have made any lasting improvements. This time I want it to be different. This time I’m going to make it <strong>so easy I can’t fail</strong>.</p>

    <h1>The growth mindset applied to my life (part 1)</h1>

  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I am now a firm believer in the <strong>growth mindset</strong>. When someone has a growth mindset, they believe that their basic abilities (intelligence, talent, strength, etc.) can be improved through hard work and practice. This is opposed to a fixed mindset: the belief that basic abilities are “fixed” and cannot be improved upon. </p>

<p>For most of my life, I have had a fixed mindset. I’m trying to change that. I want to take a moment to look back at my life and see how the different mindsets have impacted me. </p>
