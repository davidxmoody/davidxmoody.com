title: Writing before breakfast
---

**I want to become a better writer.** According to the [growth mindset](/the-growth-mindset-applied-to-my-life-part-1/), I know that this is achievable through *hard work and practice*. I have to consistently put in the time and effort and I will slowly get better. 

I knew that when I first started this blog. I set myself a schedule for publishing blog posts and have stuck to it ever since. *This has worked brilliantly.* But, it also has a few problems. Although I've never missed a post, I have procrastinated more than I would like. This last week in particular, my writing has suffered because of it.


## How to beat procrastination

Last week, I wrote about [forming the habit of doing push ups in the morning](/100-push-ups-the-ultimate-slow-gains-experiment/). Although I have only been doing it for 11 days, I'm very pleased with how well it has been going. 

I put a reminder on my task list but I haven't needed it. Every single morning without fail, it has been the first thing in my mind after waking up. This has been pleasantly surprising. I was expecting to forget occasionally but it hasn't happened so far. 

The key is the [habit loop](http://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change). There are three parts to the habit loop: The **Cue**, the **Routine** and the **Reward**. The **Cue** is the thing that triggers the habit. The **Routine** is the habit itself. The **Reward** is the benefit you get from doing it. 

Although I hadn't exactly planned it, my recent push ups habit has all three of these essential elements.

- **Cue:** Putting my feet on the ground after getting out of bed
- **Routine:** Doing some push ups
- **Reward:** Logging my progress on my laptop

## The habit of writing early

When reading through my diary, I always seem to notice the same trend: Starting work early leads to a much more satisfying day. Usually, once I start, I find it easy to keep going. You don't get much more "early" than before breakfast so I have decided to adopt the following new habit.

- **Cue:** Logging my push ups habit
- **Routine:** Getting out my notebook and working for at least one full Pomodoro session (25 minutes)
- **Reward:** Log progress on blog, go eat breakfast

I hope that starting as early as possible will help prevent procrastination later on in the day. Of course, there are a million things I could do differently. It might turn out to be a completely inappropriate idea. However, that's the beauty of self-experimentation. Even if it fails badly, at least I will have learned something. 

## Progress

Just like with my push ups post, I am going to log my progress right here. The following table shows the number of Pomodoro sessions completed *before breakfast* on each day.

*[Note that I might not get around to pushing updates every single day so expect this graph to lag behind a little bit. Dashes represent no record and zeros represent no Pomodoro sessions that day.]*
