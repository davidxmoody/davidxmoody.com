title: Changing my email address and updates to my CV
---

I have a *new email address*: <david@davidxmoody.com>


I have been running this blog for two and a half months but was still using my old Gmail address. Now that I'm thinking of applying for jobs, I want something that looks a bit more **professional**. I think my new email address makes it pretty obvious that I have my own personal domain. I'm hoping that people will see it and think *"I guess that guy must know what he's doing"*. 

Setting it up was pretty easy. I'm already registered with [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) and they offer a relatively cheap email service. 

I did have one slight problem. I had [about 800 commits on my GitHub profile](https://github.com/davidxmoody) with my old Gmail address. I could have left them as they were (GitHub allows you to associate more than one email address with your account). However, I don't think anyone else has cloned them yet and I wanted to have some degree of *consistency* across all of my public commits. 

Thankfully, GitHub provide instructions on how to [change author info in published repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/). Their instructions were easy to follow and worked perfectly. 

I also made some minor modifications to [my CV](/cv/). Nothing major. I just showed it to my Dad who gave me a few suggestions. I also added some more links to other posts on this blog. [I wrote about croquet on Friday](/my-experiences-playing-croquet/) and added a link to it in the "interests" section. Croquet has been a pretty big part of my life recently. I didn't want to just say that without any *evidence* to back it up. 

Over the next few weeks, I plan to write about my two other major hobbies which I have yet to write about: cooking and photography. I have loads of photos to share (from both) and several interesting stories. 

I could have done more this week. I feel mildly guilty about it. However, slow progress is far better than no progress and I can live with it. I have plans for this week including finally adding comments to this blog and going to Bristol again. I'll write about that next week.
